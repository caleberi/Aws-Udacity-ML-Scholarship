# Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is creating rapid and exciting changes across all levels of society because :
- serves as an  engine behind the recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
- allows for more accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
-  powers the AI assistants you might find in your home.
-  improve worker safety and speeds up drug design.

## Lesson Outline
------------------------------------------------
[ ] Discuss what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved in creating a machine learning project.

[ ]  Step into the shoes of a machine learning practitioner. Machine learning involves using trained models to generate predictions and detect patterns from data. To understand the process willbe broken down into different steps involving and examining a common process that applies to the majority of machine learning projects.

[ ] Examine  three examples , using the steps to described to solve real-life scenarios that might be faced by machine learning practitioners.
